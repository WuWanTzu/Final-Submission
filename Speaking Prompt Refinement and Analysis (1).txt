GEPT Speaking Prompt Refinement and Analysis
      —------------------------------—-----------------------------—-----------------------------—---------------------------------------------
Improvement Process (Initial Prompt & Process & Methods)
Step 1: Initial Prompt & AI Response
* Original Prompt
"Can you give me the conversation example for me to practice my GEPT test?"

* AI Response Summary
 The AI provided a short dialogue. While the sentences were easy to understand, the content was quite general and not clearly linked to any specific part of the GEPT speaking test.

* Observation
 I noticed the prompt was too vague. Phrases like “conversation example” lacked specificity, and I didn’t mention the level or part of the test. This led to an overly basic response that didn’t help much for high-intermediate preparation.

Step 2: Prompt Refinement – Adding Context
   * Refined Prompt
  "Can you give me a sample GEPT high-intermediate level speaking test conversation from Part 1 (Answering Questions), with realistic dialogue between the examiner and the test taker? "

   * AI Response Summary
 The AI gave a more structured conversation, appropriate for the high-intermediate level. The topic and vocabulary matched the test’s expectations more closely.

   * Observation
 By specifying the test level and section, I helped the AI generate more accurate and useful content. This version is more effective for targeted speaking practice.

Step 3: Using Chain-of-Thought Technique
      * Refined Prompt
 "Can you give me a sample conversation for the GEPT high-intermediate speaking test Part 1, and explain why each question is appropriate and how a strong student response would look?"

      * AI Response Summary
 The response included a question, a strong model answer, and a short explanation of why the question was asked and why the answer was good.

      * Observation
 This helped me and other learners better understand the purpose of each question and how to construct answers with clear reasons and good grammar. It added depth to the practice.

 Step 4: Using Few-Shot Learning
         * Refined Prompt
   "Give me three GEPT high-intermediate speaking test Part 1 questions, for example: Do you have a driver license? Why or why not?"  

         * AI Response Summary
 The AI gave three well-written questions with clear model answers and brief feedback. The examples showed good language variety and relevance.

         * Observation
 Providing examples helped the AI deliver more consistent, quality results. It also became more corresponding to the actual test questions.

Final Prompt Script:
You are a certified GEPT speaking examiner. Please simulate a high-intermediate GEPT speaking test conversation with the student. The test has three parts:
            1. Part 1 – Answering Questions: Ask two personal but structured questions to assess general fluency.

            2. Part 2 – Picture Description: Show a picture (describe it in words) and ask the student to describe what is happening.

            3. Part 3 – Expressing Opinions: Present a social issue and ask for the student’s opinion with justification.

After the student answers, correct their grammar and sentence fluency, and give a short explanation of the corrections. Then ask the next question. Keep the tone natural and formal, as if you are an actual examiner.
Make sure each section has realistic timing and challenge appropriate to a high-intermediate level.
Begin by saying:
“Welcome to the GEPT speaking test. Let us begin with Part 1 answering quetions.”

Explanation of Script Purpose and Functionality:
      This prompt is designed to help students practice for the GEPT high-intermediate speaking test. The AI plays the role of a test examiner, provides realistic and level-appropriate questions that closely match the actual exam format, and gives strong sample responses with feedback. This helps learners improve their fluency, grammar, and answer structure while gaining a better understanding of how to respond effectively in all three test sections: answering questions, picture-based responses, and opinion-based discussions.
