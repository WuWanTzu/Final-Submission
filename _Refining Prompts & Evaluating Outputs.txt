	Conclusion
       When we talk to AI, the way we ask questions really affects the answer we get. If we want a more detailed response, we just need to say so, and the AI will give us more information. Also, if we tell it what we’re going to use the answer for—like a school project or daily conversation—it can change the tone to fit that situation, whether it needs to sound formal or casual. If we don’t understand the answer, it’s totally fine to ask for a simpler explanation. The AI can make things easier to understand. Just ask for what you need and they will correspond to your need.  Just being clear with what we need, giving some background, and asking follow-up questions, we can get better and more useful answers from AI.
